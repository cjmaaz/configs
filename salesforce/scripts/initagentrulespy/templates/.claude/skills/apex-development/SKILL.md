description: Runs the full Apex lifecycle on `{{ORG_ALIAS}}` for creating, modifying, debugging, reviewing, validating, testing, linting, or deploying classes/triggers/batches. Requires retrieve/schema evidence, PMD, validation-only compile/tests, blocking adversarial plan and implementation gates, real deploy, coverage, and Apex-log verification.

# Apex development: deploy, test, lint, verify, format

Default target org is `{{ORG_ALIAS}}` (sandbox), source API version `66.0`. Every step below is mandatory.

Use the `adversarial-review` skill for Gate A before editing and Gate B before every real deploy/commit.

## Step 1 — Retrieve before editing

Pull the current state of every component you'll touch (class + its test + factory). See the `retrieve-before-edit` skill. Editing a stale file then deploying overwrites newer org state.

## Step 2 — Author the test class (if writing tests)

- **Find a factory first:** `find force-app -name "*TestDataFactory*" -o -name "*TestFactory*" -o -name "*DataFactory*"`. Use it; never duplicate creation logic.
- **Schema-validate every field** via the `schema-lookup` skill. Never set formula fields, guess API names, or hardcode RecordType Ids.
- **Visibility:** test private methods through public callers; static via `ClassName.method()`.
- **Structure:** `<ClassName>Test`, `@isTest` class-level (never `SeeAllData=true`), `@testSetup` for shared data, 3-6 focused methods (Setup→Execute→Assert) wrapped in `Test.startTest()/stopTest()`. Test classes are PMD-scanned; suppressions require evidence and reviewer approval.
- **Match production filters:** read every SOQL `WHERE` and set all filter fields + lookups; create positive AND negative data. Zero coverage despite passing = test data misses a filter.
- **Assertions:** `Assert.areEqual(expected, actual, 'msg')` / `Assert.isNotNull` / `Assert.isTrue` with messages — never `System.assert()`, never assertion-free.
- **Adversarial coverage:** add tests for accepted findings: 1/200/mixed batches, recursion/idempotency, null/error/partial-failure paths, concurrency where applicable, and unchanged shared/sibling/legacy behavior.

## Step 3 — Create a NEW manifest

Never overwrite shared manifests (`apex.xml`, `mainpackage.xml`, …). Create `manifest/<feature-or-fix-name>.xml` with only the modified components (`<version>66.0</version>`).

## Step 4 — PMD and validate without committing

```bash
{{PMD_PATH}} check --dir <changed-class-or-trigger-path> -R config/pmd-ruleset.xml
sf project deploy start --metadata ApexClass:<ClassName> -o {{ORG_ALIAS}} --dry-run --ignore-conflicts
sf project deploy validate --manifest './manifest/<feature>.xml' -o {{ORG_ALIAS}} \
  --test-level RunSpecifiedTests --tests <TestClassName> --wait 10
sf project deploy report --job-id <validation-job-id> -o {{ORG_ALIAS}} --json
sf apex list log -o {{ORG_ALIAS}} --json
```

Repeat PMD for every changed `.cls`/`.trigger`. Fix all findings first. The Salesforce commands compile/test without mutating the org; capture validation coverage and inspect every operation-bound test/async log before Gate B.

## Step 5 — Pass Gate B, then deploy with targeted tests

Run the `adversarial-review` implementation gate against the exact final diff plus validation/test/coverage/static-analysis and operation-bound log evidence. Resolve/re-review every blocker, recheck org freshness, then deploy:

```bash
sf project deploy start --manifest './manifest/<feature>.xml' -o {{ORG_ALIAS}} \
  --test-level RunSpecifiedTests --tests <TestClassName> --ignore-conflicts --wait 10
```

Every class ships with a `<ClassName>Test`. Production deploys need ≥75% coverage; target **90%+**. Use validation-job coverage before Gate B, then confirm runtime coverage synchronously after deploy. Any mismatch reopens Gate B before commit:

```bash
sf apex run test --class-names <TestClassName> -o {{ORG_ALIAS}} \
  --synchronous --code-coverage --result-format human --wait 10
```

## Step 6 — MANDATORY: retrieve and grep the Apex log

Deploy "Succeeded" ≠ org success. Establish a TraceFlag first; record time window, user, validation/test/AsyncApexJob IDs, and request context; query/correlate every `ApexLog`; poll async descendants; inspect every bound log. Never trust `recent` in a shared org.

```bash
sf apex list log -o {{ORG_ALIAS}} --json
sf apex get log --log-id <operation-log-id> -o {{ORG_ALIAS}}
# Repeat for every bound log; inspect errors, triggers/flows, and cumulative limits.
```

## Step 7 — Formatting

- **Method params/args on ONE line** — never split, even if long.
- **SOQL on one line if ≤200 chars**; multi-line (split at SELECT/FROM/WHERE/AND/ORDER BY) only when it exceeds 200.

## Final checklist

- [ ] Retrieved all touched components from `{{ORG_ALIAS}}`.
- [ ] Gate A passed against the approved LLD.
- [ ] PMD clean before deployment.
- [ ] Validation-only compile/full manifest tests passed.
- [ ] Validation coverage and every operation-bound test/async log inspected before Gate B.
- [ ] NEW manifest (descriptive name, only modified files).
- [ ] Test data uses a factory where one exists; fields schema-validated.
- [ ] Tests cover adversarial findings plus bulk/null/error/dependency/concurrency risks; coverage verified (≥75%, target 90%+).
- [ ] Gate B passed against the final diff/evidence.
- [ ] Every post-deploy/test/async log inspected; no discrepancy that reopens Gate B.
- [ ] Params single-line; SOQL formatted per the 200-char rule.

## Common mistakes

| Mistake | Why wrong | Correct |
|---|---|---|
| Skip syntax validation | Tests fail later for trivial reasons | Validate single-class first |
| Overwrite shared manifest | Loses other features' scope | New manifest per feature |
| Skip the log check | Hidden trigger/flow/validation failures | Always grep the log |
| Trust deploy "success" coverage | Caught exceptions / stale coverage | Synchronous run |
| Assign a formula field in a test | `Field is not writeable` | Set the fields it derives from |
| Call a private method directly | `Method is not visible` | Exercise it via a public caller |
| Use `--no-verify` / skip hooks | Hides real failures | Fix the root cause |

## When NOT to use

- Pure docs / schema TOON / manifest edits — no deploy.
- Read-only investigations.
- LWC/Aura UI changes without Apex — still deploy, but Apex tests aren't required (Jest runs separately if present).
